# App CLI

## Setup

A number of config variables are required in order to run CLI. One could either provide those in ~/.wire/config.yml in format of yaml.

## Operations

To deploy apps we need a number of steps:

- build: This generates the ditribution files along with configuration specific for the given app.yml
- publish: Upload the dist folder to IPFS. Update the hash in the app.yml
- register: Use app.yml to generate a record in WNS.

All this operations can be resumed with one command:

```
yarn wire app deploy
```

### Build app.

Before you publish your app you need to build it using `wire app build`.

Your `app.yml` MUST be present and it must have `name` and `version` defined.

You can specify the following params in your `app.yml`:

- `build`: Build command. Defaults to `yarn webpack -p`.

Example:

```yml
name: 'dxos.org/example-app'
displayName: 'Example App'
version: 0.0.0
build: yarn dist
```

Then run:

```bash
yarn run wire app build

```

### Publish to IPFS

```bash
yarn run wire app publish
```

### Registration

In package root folder:

- make sure `app.yml` is presented, with `name` and `version` fields. E.g.:

```yaml
name: 'dxos.org/example-app'
displayName: 'Example App'
version: 0.0.1
build: yarn dist
package: <IPFS HASH ID GENERATED BY PUBLISH>
```

- register app:

```bash
$ yarn run wire app register
```

### Query

```bash
$ yarn run wire app query --name 'dxos.org/example-app'

[
  {
    "id": "QmUSmSPUBhPSXSGaHhUDxBn3cjG2gjJ9BiUznvUBiJo37F",
    "type": "wrn:app",
    "name": "dxos.org/example-app",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "owners": [
      "6ee3328f65c8566cd5451e49e97a767d10a8adf7"
    ],
    "bondId": "8e340dd7cf6fc91c27eeefce9cca1406c262e93fd6f3a4f3b1e99b01161fcef3",
    "createTime": "2020-03-10T15:35:04.132179296",
    "expiryTime": "2021-03-10T15:35:04.132179296",
    "attributes": {
      "displayName": "Example App",
      "name": "dxos.org/example-app",
      "type": "wrn:app",
      "version": "0.0.1"
    }
  }
]
```

### Serve Apps

Once apps are published to ipfs and registered to WNS we can use `wire app serve` to serve the distributed files.

```bash
yarn run wire app serve
```

- `port`: Which port to start the server. Defaults to `5999`

The following URLs will be available:

- GET `/app/dxos.org/example-app/`: Latest version on WNS by default.
- GET  `/app/dxos.org/example-app@0.0.1/`

#### Apps config endpoints:

If using `dxos/config` dynamic configuration each app can request its own config from a config endpoint (`/config/config.json`).
This endpoint will serve the a json format of a YAML file located at `~/.wire/remote.yml`. This can be modified in the global configuration file:

```yaml
cli:
  app:
    serve:
      config: '/opts/apps-config/default.yml'
```


The following URLs will be available:

- GET `/app/dxos.org/example-app/config/config.json`: To match app latest version on WNS by default.
- GET  `/app/dxos.org/example-app@0.0.1/config/config.json`
