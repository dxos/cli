## App deployment

To deploy apps we need a number of steps:

- build: This generates the ditribution files along with configuration specific for the given dx.yml
- publish: Upload the dist folder to IPFS.
- register: Use dx.yml to generate a record in DXNS.

Assuming you are about to deploy "app.test" Application in "example" Authority, all these operations can be resumed with one command:

```
dx ns deploy --name "app.test" --domain "example"
```
