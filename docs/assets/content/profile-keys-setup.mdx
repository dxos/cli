## User keys

Some services will request you extra credentials, for example our service called `DXNS` requests you to have 
`uri` and `schema` to deploy an application into a Kube Network.

Here are the demo `uri` and `schema` credentials you could use:

```
    accountUri: 'vintage rubber quantum goddess install funny acquire crumble finger nuclear demand guess'
```
Under the service `dxns` located in your profile yml, fill up those credentials.

Now next time you have to deploy an app you will use them.
