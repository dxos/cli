## User keys

Some services will request you extra credentials, for example our service called `wns` requests you to have 
`bondId` and `userKey` to deploy an application into a Kube Network.

### Example

Set up your keys bondId and userKey:
profile directory: `~/.wire/profile/<PROFILE>.yml`
Here are the demo `bondId` and `userKey` credentials:

```
    userKey: 'b1e4e95dd3e3294f15869b56697b5e3bdcaa24d9d0af1be9ee57d5a59457843a'
    bondId: '8e340dd7cf6fc91c27eeefce9cca1406c262e93fd6f3a4f3b1e99b01161fcef3'
```

Under the service wns located in your profile yml, fill up those credentials.
Now next time you have to deploy an app you will use them.
