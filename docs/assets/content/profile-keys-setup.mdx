## User keys

Some services will request you extra credentials, for example our service called `DXNS` requests you to have 
`uri` and `schema` to deploy an application into a Kube Network.

Here are the demo `uri` and `schema` credentials you could use:

```
    uri: 'vintage rubber quantum goddess install funny acquire crumble finger nuclear demand guess'
    schema:
      cid: 'QmVeakWyfz8XK4FmMube6B957SiTTwgLrFFgEdNnVPugUG'
      fqn:
        app: '.dxos.App'
        bot: '.dxos.Bot'
        botFactory: '.dxos.BotFactory'
        KUBE: '.dxos.KUBE'
        service: '.dxos.Service'
        file: '.dxos.File'
```
Under the service `dxns` located in your profile yml, fill up those credentials.

Now next time you have to deploy an app you will use them.
