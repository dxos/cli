## Profile Authority

Our network supports workspaces like npm organizations.
Let's say you work for `fooBar` team and you want to publish multiples apps.

In order to register that authority (workspace) into our network you need to create auction for it:

```
$ dx dxns auction create fooBar 1000000
```

After some time (~ 10 mins), you should be able to close the auction and claim that authority, if no one else has overbidded you.

```
$ dx dxns auction close fooBar
```

```
$ dx dxns auction claim fooBar
```
