## App deployment

To deploy apps we need a number of steps:

- build: This generates the ditribution files along with configuration specific for the given app.yml
- publish: Upload the dist folder to IPFS. Update the hash in the app.yml
- register: Use app.yml to generate a record in DXNS.

Assuming you are about to deploy "app.foo" Application in fooBar Authority, all these operations can be resumed with one command:

```
$ dx app deploy --dxns --name "app.foo" --domain "fooBar"
```
