## App deployment

To deploy apps we need a number of steps:

- build: This generates the ditribution files along with configuration specific for the given app.yml
- publish: Upload the dist folder to IPFS. Update the hash in the app.yml
- register: Use app.yml to generate a record in WNS.

All these operations can be resumed with one command:

> You could use optional `--name` argument in order to assign specific name to the record.

```
$ dx app deploy --name "wrn://<AUTHORITY>/application/<APP_NAME>"
```
